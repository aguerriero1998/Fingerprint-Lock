#Fingerprint Scanner Lock

This is a Fingerprint scanner lock written in the Arduino IDE for the Arduino Uno.

I first attempted to write this using pure C with the avr-libc but interfacing the Arduino with the fingerprint scanner in pure C was too difficult. The C code is included in this repository.

In order to reproduce this project you will need the following Items An Arduino Uno A 3 * 4 Matrix Keypad The Adafruit Fingerprint Scanner
